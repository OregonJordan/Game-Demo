# Game-Demo

This is a demo game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The artwork and soundfx used in this demo are not my own and are used for educational purposes only. The code however is mine. 

How to play: 
 1) You are a barbarian, go kill stuff. Explore the world around you by pressing the "Explore" button.
 2) Once you encounter something viel, try to kill it by pressing the "Attack" button.
 3) If you're not feeling up for a fight, try running away by pressing the "Run Away" button.
 4) If you choose to fight, three attack dice and one block dice will appear for each character per attack. Whoever has the highest total     attack dice and has the highest block dice value wins the attack. The total attack value of all three dice from the losing attacker is     subtracted from the winning attackers dice total to compute the damage received. 
 5) If the loser has a higher block dice than the block dice of the winner, the attack fails and no damage is received.
 6) If the attack totals for both characters are even, no damage is given to either character.
 7) Both characters roll a run dice if you attempt to run away. If your run dice is less than or equal to your attackers run dice you will     receive the full attack dice total in damage so choose wisely.
 8) Explore, Fight until you are victorious or you die!
